Problem Introduction


RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. The company has generally released movies for the Indian audience, but they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

 

The production company wants to plan every move analytically based on data and has approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past 3 years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights to help the company start their new project.

 

You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on your insights. For your convenience, the analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are listed in the script below. You have to write the solution code below every question and submit the same SQL script file with the solution in the ‘Submission’ segment.



About the Project
Where do I get the data from?

You can get detailed information about the data set and database creation in the next segment.

 

Where do I write the code?

The SQL script file above contains all the tasks you need to perform. You must write the code for each task/question below the question itself.

 

How do I submit the assignment?

Once you write the codes in the question script file, the same script file should be submitted in the ‘Submission’ segment.
